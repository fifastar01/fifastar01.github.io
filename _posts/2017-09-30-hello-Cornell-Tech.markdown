Also, here is the process flow chart for taxi ordering (Yes, you can call a taxi by conversation in wechat), combining both Coversational UI and Graphic UI and using 3rd party API:

Last, I recently introduced wechat little app for group contact. Here is the sketch prototype (Sorry I did not translate them into English):
